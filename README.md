###WikiCar
v 4.2.0 <br>
This is a chrome extension that allows you to play a wikipedia race... using a car.

####Wikipedia Race
So a Wikipedia race goes like this:

Start page --> link --> link --> End page;

and you try to get the best time.


####OUR Wikipedia Race
You're assigned a random starting page and a random ending page. You have to traverse the void between with the help of your car.
Hit the 'play' button, and a car and three randomly placed coins will appear on the screen (the more coins you get in a short amount of
time boosts your points). Use the arrow keys to control scrolling and WASD to control the turning directiion and vector of the car (see
the 'instructions' pane in the toolbar for help), navigate to the link you want to go to, and hit 'c' to activate your cursor. Click the link,
and you'll be off to the next page to find your next connection.

####Rules
Points are based on num of coins / time.
Points decay.
You can quit at any time.

###Installation
Download as .zip or clone the repository. Go to Chrome --> Settings --> Extensions and enable Developer Mode. Hit **Pack Extension** and
select the root directory of the folder. Then, after everything is squared away, hit **Load Unpacked Extension** and select the folder.
Navigate to any Wikipedia page, and you'll be set.
